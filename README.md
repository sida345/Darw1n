## Tutorial for using Darw1n

After opening Darw1n.exe, enter the UDID, usually it is among the information about the device in 3uTools, copy it and paste it into the program, then specify the path to the modified com.apple.mobilegestalt.plist, then just wait, iBook will open (download it in advance to the AppStore) download any book, then a message with the image of chess will appear, click "Retry" it may happen again several times, then the device should reboot (if it did not and the program writes that everything is successfully completed, then restart the iPhone manually) Done!
